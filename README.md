This project was created to support employee management in a local pizza restaurant that I worked in. It gives you a possibility to register as a manager, then add your list of workers to the database and after each working day you make a report who has worked on this day and how many hours have they worked. Those shifts are also stored in a DB and you can request the website to generate a summary from selected time period. More functionalities are yet to be done
